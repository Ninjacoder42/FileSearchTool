# FileSearchTool

FileSearchTool is a simple yet powerful utility for searching files in Windows. It allows you to quickly find files based on a search term within a specified directory and its subdirectories.

## Installation

1. Download the `FileSearchToolSetup.exe` from the latest release on this GitHub repository.
2. Run the `FileSearchToolSetup.exe` file.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

The installer will create shortcuts in your Start Menu for both the application and the help file.

## Running the Application

To run FileSearchTool:

1. Open the Start Menu.
2. Look for "FileSearchTool" in your programs list.
3. Click on the FileSearchTool icon to launch the application.

Alternatively, you can navigate to the installation directory (usually `C:\Program Files\FileSearchTool`) and run `FileSearchTool.exe` directly.

## Using the Help File

A comprehensive help file (FileSearchToolUserGuide.chm) is included with the installation. To access it:

1. Open the Start Menu.
2. Look for "FileSearchTool Help" in your programs list.
3. Click on the "FileSearchTool Help" icon to open the help file.

### If the Help File Doesn't Open

If you're unable to open the .chm help file, it may be "blocked" by Windows for security reasons. To unblock it:

1. Navigate to the FileSearchTool installation directory (usually `C:\Program Files\FileSearchTool`).
2. Right-click on `FileSearchToolUserGuide.chm`.
3. Select "Properties" from the context menu.
4. At the bottom of the Properties window, you may see a "Security" section with a message saying "This file came from another computer and might be blocked to help protect this computer."
5. If you see this message, check the box next to "Unblock".
6. Click "Apply" and then "OK".

After unblocking, you should be able to open the help file normally.

## Basic Usage

1. Launch FileSearchTool.
2. In the "Directory" field, enter the path of the directory you want to search, or click "Browse" to select a directory.
3. In the "Search Term" field, enter the term you want to search for in file names.
4. Click "Search" to begin the search process.
5. Results will be displayed in the list below. Double-click on a result to open its containing folder.
